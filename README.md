# Android-Web-Dashboard

A Kotlin Android App for realtime web dashboards.

1. Create a webpage with a dashboard of stats/info/live updating things. Probably best as SPA. You will probably be using React; everyone else is. Maybe make use of flexbox etc so that it can work well on different device sizes.
2. Buy a cheap Android tablet (perhaps one of those Black Friday Amazon Kindle Fires) or maybe one of those set top box Android things. Best if it has Android 4.4 (Kitkat) as it does full screen well (and has better modern CSS support).
3. Install this; enter url; place somewhere. Bask in information.
